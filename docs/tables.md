# Tables

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2016-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw-fabricsqldb](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw-fabricsqldb.md)]

Tables are database objects that contain all the data in a database. In tables, data is logically organized in a row-and-column format similar to a spreadsheet. Each row represents a unique record, and each column represents a field in the record. For example, a table that contains employee data for a company might contain a row for each employee and columns representing employee information such as employee number, name, address, job title, and home telephone number. 

- The number of tables in a database is limited only by the number of objects allowed in a database (2,147,483,647). A standard user-defined table can have up to 1,024 columns. The number of rows in the table is limited only by the storage capacity of the server. 

- You can assign properties to the table and to each column in the table to control the data that is allowed and other properties. For example, you can create constraints on a column to disallow null values or provide a default value if a value is not specified, or you can assign a key constraint on the table that enforces uniqueness or defines a relationship between tables. 

- The data in the table can be compressed either by row or by page. Data compression can allow more rows to be stored on a page. For more information, see [Data compression](../data-compression/data-compression.md). 

## Types of tables

 Besides the standard role of basic user-defined tables, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides the following types of tables that serve special purposes in a database. 

### Partitioned tables

Partitioned tables are tables whose data is horizontally divided into units which might be spread across more than one filegroup in a database. Partitioning makes large tables or indexes more manageable by letting you access or manage subsets of data quickly and efficiently, while maintaining the integrity of the overall collection. By default, [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports up to 15,000 partitions. For more information, see [Partitioned tables and indexes](../partitions/partitioned-tables-and-indexes.md).

### Temporary tables

Temporary tables are stored in `tempdb`. There are two types of temporary tables: **local** and **global**. They differ from each other in their names, their visibility, and their availability.

- Local temporary tables, also known as session-scoped temporary tables, have a single number sign (`#`) as the first character of their names; they are visible only to the current connection for the user, and they are deleted when the user disconnects from the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
- Global temporary tables have two number signs (`##`) as the first characters of their names; they are visible to any user after they are created, and they are deleted when all users referencing the table disconnect from the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

In Fabric Data Warehouse, only session-scoped temp tables are supported, and are not affected by [Time travel hints](/fabric/data-warehouse/time-travel).

#### Reduced recompilations for workloads using temporary tables across multiple scopes

[!INCLUDE[ss2019](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] under all database compatibility levels reduces recompilations for workloads using temporary tables across multiple scopes. This feature is also enabled in Azure SQL Database under database compatibility level 150 for all deployment models. Prior to this feature, when referencing a temporary table with a data manipulation language (DML) statement (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`), if the temporary table was created by an outer scope batch, this would result in a recompile of the DML statement each time it is executed. With this improvement, SQL Server performs additional lightweight checks to avoid unnecessary recompilations:

- Check if the outer-scope module used for creating the temporary table at compile time is the same one used for consecutive executions. 
- Keep track of any data definition language (DDL) changes made at initial compilation and compare them with DDL operations for consecutive executions.

The end result is a reduction in extraneous recompilations and CPU-overhead.

### System tables

[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] stores the data that defines the configuration of the server and all its tables in a special set of tables known as system tables. Users cannot directly query or update the system tables. The information in the system tables is made available through the system views. For a list, see [System Tables (Transact-SQL)](../system-tables/system-tables-transact-sql.md).

### Wide tables

Wide tables use [sparse columns](use-sparse-columns.md) to increase the total of columns that a table can have to 30,000. Sparse columns are ordinary columns that have an optimized storage for null values. Sparse columns reduce the space requirements for null values at the cost of more overhead to retrieve nonnull values. A wide table has defined a [column set](use-column-sets.md), which is an untyped XML representation that combines all the sparse columns of a table into a structured output. The number of indexes and statistics is also increased to 1,000 and 30,000, respectively. The maximum size of a wide table row is 8,019 bytes. Therefore, most of the data in any particular row should be `NULL`. The maximum number of nonsparse columns plus computed columns in a wide table remains 1,024. 

Wide tables have the following performance implications.

- Wide tables can increase the cost to maintain indexes on the table. We recommend that the number of indexes on a wide table be limited to the indexes that are required by the business logic. As the number of indexes increases, so does the DML compile-time and memory requirement. Nonclustered indexes should be filtered indexes that are applied to data subsets. For more information, see [Create filtered indexes](../indexes/create-filtered-indexes.md). 

- Applications can dynamically add and remove columns from wide tables. When columns are added or removed, compiled query plans are also invalidated. We recommend that you design an application to match the projected workload so that schema changes are minimized. 

- When data is added and removed from a wide table, performance can be affected. Applications must be designed for the projected workload so that changes to the table data are minimized. 

- Limit the execution of DML statements on a wide table that update multiple rows of a clustering key. These statements can require significant memory resources to compile and execute. 

- Switch partition operations on wide tables can be slow and might require large amounts of memory to process. The performance and memory requirements are proportional to the total number of columns in both the source and target partitions. 

- Update cursors that update specific columns in a wide table should list the columns explicitly in the FOR UPDATE clause. This will help optimize performance when you use cursors.
